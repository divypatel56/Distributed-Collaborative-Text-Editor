Shared Collaborative TextEditor App

ShareDoc : A collaborative text editor that allows multiple users to work concurrently on a shared document, enabling real time updates and conflict free editing.
The project leverages distributed system concepts to ensure high availability, reliability, and efficiency. The editor uses technologies like React, Node.js, Quill.js, Redis, MongoDB, and NGINX to create a distributed robust and efficient architecture. 


To Run 
Clone the repo Project_COSC4437.
 1. You need to install Node js. Go to Google and install node js. 
 2. After installing the node run npm -v in PowerShell or cmd to verify that the node was installed successfully.  
 3. Install MongoDB in your system. 
 4. Go to the  server folder, Open Terminal, and run npm install. 
 5. Go to the Client folder, open the terminal, and run npm Install.
 6. Install NGINX and edit NGINX conf file.  

Current Functionality. 
- Multiple server-client distributed systems.
- Fault tolerance. Handle Server Failures.
- Redis for real-time updates across multiple clients.
- Users can create new documents with unique document IDs. 
- Multiple users can work on the same document and make concurrent changes with real-time updates. 
- Auto-saving document data in every 2 m/s. Using MongoDB
- Every document has a separate room. For example, if a user opens two different documents and updates one of them, the other document won't be modified.
- Conflict-free editing.

Technology Stack Overview
1.	Frontend(React + Quill.js):
       o	The app uses react and Quill(a rich text editing interface) for the front end.
       o	The main reason to choose Quill is its delta functionality, which provides an efficient solution to track user updates and enable conflict free editing.
       o	React helps to create a user-friendly UI and also manages navigation between text documents using unique IDs generated by uuidV4.
  	
2. Backend(Node.js+Socket.IO):
      o	App uses Node,js for backend server implementation. 
      o	Backend servers handle API and WebSocket requests.
      o	Socket.IO enables real-time communication between clients -servers  for collaborative editing.
   
3.	Database(MongoDB):
      o	Supports schema-less document storage for flexibility.
      o	Store document data persistently. 

4.	Redis(Pub-Sub Model): 
      o	Act as a broker between servers and facilities for Socket.IO.
      o	Ensures data replication and enables consistence synchronization across clients connected to different servers.
  	
6.	NGINX(Load Balancer):
      o	Distributes the incoming traffic to Backen servers.
      o	Handles server failures and maintain high availability.
      o	Handles both HTTP and WebSocket connections.
